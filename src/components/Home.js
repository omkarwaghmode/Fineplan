              The Scheme aims to provide long-term capital appreciation. It will maintain a minimum exposure of 80% to Large Cap stocks, as defined by SEBI, which currently are the 100 largest companies in India in terms of full market capitalization.
            </p>        
            <p>     Generally, large cap companies are well established businesses that are in operation for a longer period of time and are well positioned to absorb business pressures across various market cycles. Due to their size, they also benefit from economies of scale.
            </p>        
            <p>        The Scheme will remain diversified across key sectors and economic variables.</p><p/>

            <p className="card-text" /><p>When you invest for five years or more, you can expect gains that comfortably beat the inflation rate as well as returns from fixed income options. But be prepared for ups and downs in your investment value along the way.</p>
            <p>
              This fund is mandated to invest at least 25 per cent of its money each in stocks of large, medium and small-sized companies. Such funds can be fairly volatile since at least 50% of their assets will always be invested in mid and small cap stocks which generally experience more severe ups and downs. This makes them suitable for long-term investors who donâ€™t mind higher risk, but we suggest you also consider flexi-cap funds which offer complete freedom to fund managers to choose companies of different sizes.</p>
            <p>
              Like for all equity funds, you must invest only through the SIP route. Click here to read a primer on SIP investing.
            </p><p>
              Warning: Do not invest in this, or any other multi-cap fund, if you need to redeem your investment in less than five years.

            <h6>Taxability of earnings:</h6>
            <p>
              Capital gains
              If the mutual fund units are sold after 1 year from the date of investment, gains upto Rs 1 lakh in a financial year are exempt from tax. Gains over Rs 1 lakh are taxed at the rate of 10%.
              If the mutual fund units are sold within 1 year from the date of investment, entire amount of gain is taxed at the rate of 15%.
              No tax is to be paid as long as you continue to hold the units.
              Dividends
            </p>
            <p>
              Dividends are added to the income of the investors and taxed according to their respective tax slabs. Further, if an investor's dividend income exceeds Rs. 5,000 in a financial year, the fund house also deducts a TDS of 10% before distributing the dividend.</p><p />
